# Check Your Render Deployment Status

## How to Monitor Your Deployment

1. Go to your Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com

2. Find your service named `ekyc-blockchain-app`

3. Click on the service to view its details

4. Check the "Events" tab to see the deployment progress

## Common Deployment Stages

1. **Building** - Your code is being built (5-10 minutes)
2. **Deploying** - Your application is being deployed
3. **Live** - Your application is successfully deployed

## If Deployment Fails Again

If you see the same Prisma error, the issue has now been fixed in your repository. Simply:

1. Go to your service in the Render Dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" â†’ "Clear build cache & deploy"
3. This will pull the latest changes and use the fixed package.json

## Expected Success

With the changes I've made:
- Prisma is now in dependencies (available during build)
- All Prisma commands now use `npx` prefix
- The build should complete successfully

## Your Application URL

Once deployed, your application will be available at:
https://ekyc-blockchain-app.onrender.com

## Test Endpoints

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- Health check: https://ekyc-blockchain-app.onrender.com/api/health
- KYC stats: https://ekyc-blockchain-app.onrender.com/api/kyc/stats
- Admin stats: https://ekyc-blockchain-app.onrender.com/api/admin/stats
