# üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Prisma CLI Not Found
**Error**: `sh: 1: prisma: not found`
**Root Cause**: Prisma was in `devDependencies` instead of `dependencies`
**Fix**: 
- Moved `prisma` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in [package.json](file:///c%3A/Users/ARYAN/Desktop/newbuild/builder-quantum-den/package.json)
- Updated all Prisma commands to use `npx` prefix (e.g., `npx prisma generate`)

### 2. Outdated Lock File
**Error**: `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE`
**Root Cause**: [pnpm-lock.yaml](file://c:\Users\ARYAN\Desktop\newbuild\builder-quantum-den\pnpm-lock.yaml) was out of sync with [package.json](file://c:\Users\ARYAN\Desktop\newbuild\builder-quantum-den\package.json) after dependency changes
**Fix**: 
- Updated [pnpm-lock.yaml](file://c:\Users\ARYAN\Desktop\newbuild\builder-quantum-den\pnpm-lock.yaml) to match current dependencies
- Committed and pushed the updated lock file

## Changes Deployed

1. **[package.json](file:///c%3A/Users/ARYAN/Desktop/newbuild/builder-quantum-den/package.json)**:
